# ICP Azle Name Service

This azle canister project works similar to how naming service works on the Ethereum blockchain (ENS). Each user registers with a name of their choice and their account address is  linked to the registered name. Each registered name can then be associated with some data stored on the Internet Computer. Below are the functionalities of the canister: 

- Register name
- Set name data 
- Update name data
- Clear data associated with a name
- View all registered names
- View data associated with all registered names
- Checks the availability of any name
